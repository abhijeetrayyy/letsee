# Profile visibility toggles: what they mean and what they do

These three checkboxes in profile settings control what appears in the **“Reviews, ratings & diary”** section. They are stored on `users`: `profile_show_diary`, `profile_show_ratings`, `profile_show_public_reviews`.

---

## 1. Show my diary on my profile

**What it is:**  
**Diary** = your **private notes** for each title. Only you can ever see them; visitors never see your diary (the API always hides diary from non-owners).

**When ON (checked):**  
You see your diary notes on your own profile in the “Reviews, ratings & diary” section.

**When OFF (unchecked):**  
You do **not** see your diary on your profile. You can still add or edit diary on each movie/TV page; it just doesn’t appear in the profile section.

**Who it affects:**  
Only **you** (the profile owner). Visitors never see diary regardless of this setting.

## 2. Show my ratings to visitors

**What it is:**  
**Ratings** = your **1–10 score** for each title (the number you give when you rate a movie or show).

**When ON (checked):**  
Visitors (friends or public, depending on “Profile visibility”) see your scores next to each title on your profile.

**When OFF (unchecked):**  
Visitors do **not** see your ratings on your profile. You still see your own ratings when you view your profile.

**Who it affects:**  
Only **visitors** viewing your profile. You always see your own ratings.

## 3. Show my public reviews to visitors

**What it is:**  
**Public review** = the review you choose to **share** for each title. It’s separate from your private diary: diary is only for you; public review is what others can see (e.g. in “Reviews” or on your profile).

**When ON (checked):**  
Visitors see your public reviews in the “Reviews, ratings & diary” section on your profile.

**When OFF (unchecked):**  
Visitors do **not** see your public reviews on your profile. You still see your own public reviews when you view your profile.

**Who it affects:**  
Only **visitors** viewing your profile. You always see your own public reviews.

## Summary

| Toggle | What it controls | ON = | OFF = |
|--------|------------------|------|-------|
| **Show my diary on my profile** | Your private notes on your profile | You see them on your profile | You don’t see them on your profile (you can still edit on title pages) |
| **Show my ratings to visitors** | Your 1–10 scores | Visitors see them | Visitors don’t see them (you still see yours) |
| **Show my public reviews to visitors** | Your shared review text | Visitors see them | Visitors don’t see them (you still see yours) |

**Note:** “Profile visibility” (Public / Friends only / Only me) controls **who can see your profile at all**. The three checkboxes above control **what** those visitors see (ratings and public reviews) and **what you see** on your own profile (diary).
